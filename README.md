# sorting_algo_visualizer

A educational animation of five popular sorting algorithms, such as Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort and Quick Sort. 
I created a GUI to display the Algorithms using Python and the Tkinter library.
It also includes a scaler to adjust the array size and buttons to change the algorithm and the sorting speed.
The animation uses highlights to show the selection and sorting process.
